### Monorepo Project Template with PNPM

This project provides a base setup with some commands and helpers for creating a monorepo (with any framework) using **PNPM**.

## Command List

### 1. Run a Command in a Specific Folder

To run a command within a specific folder (e.g., `remix-blog`), use the following:

```bash
pnpm --filter remix-blog dev
```

###2. Install a Package in a Specific Project
To install a package (e.g., typescript) as a development dependency in a specific project (e.g., shared-ui), use:

```bash
pnpm add --filter shared-ui typescript -D
```

### 3. Add a Package to an App

To add a package to a specific app (e.g., <app>), use the following command. This will add the package to the specified app in the workspace:

```bash
pnpm add <package> --filter <app> --workspace
```

Note: When linking a package, PNPM will create a symlink inside the node_modules of the target app to avoid file duplication.

### 4. Run a Command in All Folders

To run a command across all projects in the workspace, use:

```bash
pnpm run -r "command"
```
